# EggLocke
A tool used to generate Egglocke save files.
Simply load your save, change the settings to what you desire and click on "Generate Egglocke" to generate the new Egglocke save file.

I added support for:

-Pokemon Emerald EX

-Pokemon Last Fire Red

-Pokemon Radical Red

-Pokemon GS Chronicles

-Pokemon Unbound

If you want to add your own rom hack, simply make your own XML file and place it in the Pokedex folder. 
If you use the CFRU engine, be sure to place the (CFRU), right before .xml.
